          pugixml is a light-weight C++ XML processing library. It consists of a DOM-like interface with rich traversal/modification capabilities, 
	  an extremely fast XML parser which constructs the DOM tree from an XML file/buffer, and an XPath 1.0 implementation for complex data-driven 
          tree queries. Full Unicode support is also available, with two Unicode interface variants and conversions between different Unicode encodings
          (which happen automatically during parsing/saving). The library is extremely portable and easy to integrate and use. pugixml is developed and
          maintained since 2006 and has many users. All code is distributed under the MIT license, making it completely free to use in both open-source 
          and proprietary applications.
